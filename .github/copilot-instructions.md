# GitHub Copilot Instructions for MkDocs Snippet Lens

## Project Overview

MkDocs Snippet Lens is a VS Code extension that enhances the editing experience for MkDocs documentation by detecting `--8<--` snippet references, making them clickable, and providing inline previews of referenced content.

**Current Phase:** v0.1.0 MVP - Building core functionality

## Architecture & Module Organization

Follow a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **SnippetDetector** - Detects snippet syntax in markdown files using regex
- **PathResolver** - Resolves relative/absolute paths to referenced files
- **DocumentLinkProvider** - Provides clickable links for snippet references
- **PreviewManager** - Manages ghost text decorations for content previews
- **extension.ts** - Main entry point, coordinates all components

Each module should be in its own file under `src/` and have a corresponding test file.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript with no implicit any
- Prefer interfaces for public APIs, types for internal structures
- Use readonly for immutable properties
- Document public methods with JSDoc comments
- Include parameter descriptions and return types in JSDoc

### VS Code Extension Patterns
- Register all disposables with `context.subscriptions.push()`
- Use `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration()` for settings
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Use VS Code theming colors (e.g., `editorCodeLens.foreground`)
- Follow VS Code API patterns and conventions

### Naming Conventions
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `SnippetDetector`)
- Interfaces: PascalCase with `I` prefix if needed (e.g., `ISnippetInfo`)
- Methods/functions: camelCase (e.g., `detectSnippets`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_PREVIEW_LINES`)
- Private members: prefix with underscore (e.g., `_cache`)

## Key Technical Details

### Snippet Detection (MVP)
Use this regex pattern for v0.1.0:
```
/--8<--\s+["']([^"']+)["']/g
```

**In Scope for MVP:**
- Simple file inclusion: `--8<-- "path/to/file"`
- Both single and double quotes
- Whole file inclusion only

**Out of Scope for MVP:**
- Named sections (`:section_name`)
- Line ranges (`:start:end`)
- Multiple ranges
- Recursive snippet expansion

### Path Resolution Precedence
Follow this exact order when resolving paths:

1. If path is absolute (starts with `/` or drive letter on Windows), use as-is
2. Try relative to current markdown file's directory
3. Try relative to workspace root
4. Try relative to configured `basePath` setting
5. If all fail, return undefined (caller handles error)

Document this precedence in code comments.

### Preview Behavior (MVP)
- Display first 20 lines of snippet content (hardcoded for MVP)
- Show truncation indicator if file exceeds limit: `... (XX more lines)`
- Use faded italic text with `editorCodeLens.foreground` color
- Global toggle only - OFF by default
- No per-snippet toggle in MVP

## Development Methodology

### Test Driven Development (TDD)

**This project strictly follows TDD practices. All code MUST be written using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.**

You are an expert software engineer following a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow.

**Core TDD Principles**
- **Never write production code without a failing test first.**
- **Tests Drive Design:** Let the test dictate the API and architecture. If the test is hard to write, the design is likely wrong.
- **Write Tests Incrementally:** Focus on small, atomic tests that verify exactly one logical behavior.
- **No Implementation in Advance:** Only write the code strictly needed to pass the current test.

**Phase 1: Analysis & Planning**
Before writing any code:
1. Analyze the request.
2. Create a checklist of small, isolated implementation steps.

**Phase 2: The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**
Execute the checklist items one by one. You must complete the *entire* cycle for an item before moving to the next.

1. **RED (The Failing Test):**
   - Write a single, focused test for the current checklist item.
   - Run the test.
   - Confirm it fails with an *expected* error (e.g., assertion failure or missing definition).

2. **GREEN (Make it Pass):**
   - Write the *minimum amount of code* required to make the test pass.
   - It is acceptable to use hardcoded values or "quick and dirty" logic here just to get to green ("Sin explicitly").
   - *Constraint:* Do not implement future features or optimizations yet.

3. **REFACTOR (Make it Right):**
   - **Critical Step:** You must clean up the code *before* starting the next test.
   - Remove duplication, improve variable names, and apply design patterns.
   - Ensure all tests (new and old) still pass.

**Operating Rules**
- If a test passes immediately without implementation, the test is invalid or the logic already exists.
- If the implementation reveals a complex logic gap, add it to your checklist, but finish the current cycle first.
- Do not generate a "wall of text." Keep code blocks small and focused on the current step.
- Stop and ask for clarification if a step is ambiguous.

#### Example TDD Session

```typescript
// Step 1: Write first failing test
test('should detect snippet with double quotes', () => {
  const detector = new SnippetDetector();
  const result = detector.detect('--8<-- "file.txt"');
  expect(result.length).toBe(1);
});

// Run test → RED (SnippetDetector doesn't exist)

// Step 2: Minimal code to pass
class SnippetDetector {
  detect(text: string) { return [{}]; }
}

// Run test → GREEN

// Step 3: Write next failing test
test('should extract file path from snippet', () => {
  const detector = new SnippetDetector();
  const result = detector.detect('--8<-- "file.txt"');
  expect(result[0].path).toBe('file.txt');
});

// Run test → RED (path is undefined)

// Step 4: Implement just enough to pass
class SnippetDetector {
  detect(text: string) {
    const match = /--8<--\s+"([^"]+)"/.exec(text);
    return match ? [{ path: match[1] }] : [];
  }
}

// Run test → GREEN
// Continue iterating...
```

## Testing Requirements

### Coverage Target
Maintain **100% code coverage** at all times through TDD practice.

**Enforcement:**
- Tests must fail if coverage falls below 100%
- CI builds must fail on insufficient coverage
- No code can be committed without 100% coverage

### Test Organization
- Unit tests in `src/test/unit/`
- Integration tests in `src/test/integration/`
- Use descriptive test names: `should detect snippet with double quotes`
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Test edge cases: unicode paths, spaces, special characters, Windows paths

### Critical Test Cases
- Regex pattern matching (all quote variants)
- Path resolution precedence (test each fallback level)
- Content truncation logic
- Cross-platform path handling (Windows vs Unix)
- Error conditions (file not found, permission denied, etc.)

## Configuration Settings (MVP)

```typescript
{
  "mkdocsSnippetLens.enabled": boolean,        // default: true
  "mkdocsSnippetLens.basePath": string,        // default: ""
  "mkdocsSnippetLens.previewMaxLines": number  // default: 20
}
```

Access via `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('mkdocsSnippetLens')`.

## Performance Considerations

### MVP Acceptable Limits
- Synchronous file loading is acceptable for MVP
- Document known limitation if >50 snippets cause lag
- No caching in v0.1.0 - re-scan on file open/save

### Future Optimization (v0.2+)
- Async file loading
- Content caching
- Incremental updates on typing

## Error Handling

- Never throw errors to VS Code - catch and handle gracefully
- Show diagnostics for file-not-found errors
- Log errors to output channel for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle cross-platform path issues (drive letters, separators)

## Documentation

- Update CHANGELOG.md for all user-visible changes
- Keep README.md examples up-to-date
- Document limitations in README known issues section
- Use inline comments for complex logic
- Reference REQUIREMENTS.md sections when implementing features

## Key Documents

Always consult these before implementing features:
- **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Feature specifications and requirements
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Phased development plan and MVP scope
- **RISKS.md** - Known risks and mitigation strategies

## Commands (MVP Scope)

For v0.1.0, implement only:
- `mkdocs-snippet-lens.toggleAllPreviews` - Toggle all previews on/off

Additional commands are scheduled for later releases per IMPLEMENTATION.md.

## Code Quality Checklist

Before committing, ensure:- [ ] **TDD process followed** - Tests written before implementation- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage == 100%
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npm run check-types`)
- [ ] No ESLint warnings (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] All disposables are registered
- [ ] Error handling is in place
- [ ] JSDoc comments for public APIs
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility considered

## Current MVP Priorities

Focus on these in order:
1. Basic snippet detection (regex pattern matching)
2. Path resolution with proper precedence
3. DocumentLinkProvider for clickable links
4. Simple ghost text preview (20 lines, hardcoded)
5. Toggle all previews command
6. Unit tests for all modules (100% coverage required)

Avoid scope creep - defer advanced features to v0.2.0+ per IMPLEMENTATION.md.

## Git Commit Conventions
