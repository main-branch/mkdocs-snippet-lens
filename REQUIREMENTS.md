# Project Requirements: MkDocs Snippet Previewer

This is a fantastic productivity booster for documentation workflows. The default
MkDocs editing experience often involves a lot of context switching; bringing that
content directly into the editor is a high-value feature.

## About This Document

This document defines the **complete, aspirational requirements** for the MkDocs
Snippet Lens extension. It captures the end-state vision of the project, documenting
all features, capabilities, and constraints that should eventually be implemented.

**Purpose:**

- Define **what** the extension should do (features, behavior, constraints)
- Establish quality standards (performance, security, accessibility)
- Provide stable reference for design decisions and testing
- Serve as the single source of truth for "done" criteria

**What's Included:**

- Functional requirements (user-facing features)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, accessibility)
- Configuration settings and their defaults
- User stories and use cases
- Documentation requirements
- Technical specifications and constraints

**What's NOT Included:**

- Implementation details (see `IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- Release schedules or phasing (see `IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- Development tasks or milestones (see `IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- Technical architecture decisions (those go in code comments/ADRs)

**Relationship to Other Documents:**

- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Breaks requirements into phased releases and defines **how**
  and **when** features will be built
- `RISKS.md` - Identifies risks and mitigation strategies for delivering these
  requirements
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Tracks which requirements have been implemented in each release

**Maintenance:**

- Update when requirements change or new needs are identified
- Requirements are relatively stable; changes should be deliberate
- All requirement changes should be reviewed for impact on existing implementation
- Version controlled with the codebase

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Name:** MkDocs Snippet Lens (or similar)

**Goal:** Enhance the VS Code editing experience for MkDocs users by detecting
snippet references (`--8<--`) and providing immediate access to the referenced
content without leaving the current file.

**License:** MIT License

### 1.1 Assumptions

This extension is built with the following assumptions about the target environment
and user base:

**User Knowledge and Behavior:**

- Users are familiar with MkDocs and its snippet syntax (`--8<--`)
- Users follow MkDocs snippet conventions as documented in the [MkDocs snippets
  documentation](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/)
- Users have basic familiarity with VS Code features (command palette, settings,
  keyboard shortcuts)
- Users understand the difference between preview content (read-only) and actual file
  content
- Users want to preview snippet content inline as an alternative to opening files
  separately

**File System and Environment:**

- Workspace is on a local file system (not remote/SSH/Codespaces in initial version)
- Users have appropriate read permissions for snippet files within their workspace
- Snippet files are text-based and can be rendered as UTF-8 encoded text
- Markdown documentation files use standard `.md` file extension
- File paths in snippet references use forward slashes `/` or platform-appropriate
  separators
- Symbolic links, if used, point to files within the workspace boundary

**Project Structure:**

- Documentation projects are organized in VS Code workspaces or folders
- Snippet files are located within the workspace (or accessible via relative paths)
- File structure remains relatively stable (not rapidly changing during editing)
- Projects contain a reasonable number of snippet references (optimized for < 100 per
  file)

**Technical Environment:**

- VS Code version 1.85.0 or later is installed
- Node.js runtime is available (bundled with VS Code)
- Sufficient system resources for VS Code extension operation (see performance
  requirements)
- Platform is Windows 10+, macOS 11+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ equivalent)

**Privacy and Security:**

- Users prefer privacy and do not want telemetry/data collection
- Users work with trusted content within their own workspaces
- Path traversal protection is desired to prevent accidental access outside workspace
- Users accept that previews are local-only and require no network access

**Development and Maintenance:**

- The extension will be actively maintained for bug fixes and security updates
- Breaking changes will follow semantic versioning (major version bumps)
- Community feedback will guide feature prioritization post-v1.0
- MkDocs snippet syntax remains stable or changes are backwards-compatible

**Out of Scope Assumptions:**

The following are explicitly NOT assumed and represent potential future enhancements:

- Multi-root workspace support (limited support initially)
- Remote workspace support (SSH, Codespaces, WSL)
- Real-time collaborative editing scenarios
- Snippet files in binary formats or requiring special rendering
- Non-standard markdown file extensions (only `.md` initially)
- Integration with MkDocs build process or preview server

## 2. Functional Requirements

Requirement implementation status is marked as follows:

- **[DONE]** Implemented in v0.1.0 (see CHANGELOG)
- **[PARTIAL]** Basic implementation completed, but additional features planned
- **[PLANNED]** Deferred to a future release (see IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### 2.1 Snippet Detection

- **[DONE] Pattern Matching:** Detects `--8<-- "path/to/file.ext"` and `--8<--
  'path/to/file.ext'` syntax including named sections (`:section`), explicit line
  ranges (`:start:end`), and multiple ranges (`:1:3,5:7`). Block format, start-only
  ranges, end-only ranges, negative indexes, disabled/escaped snippets, and URL
  snippets are **[PLANNED]**.
- **[DONE] Trigger Events:** Detection occurs on file open and save. Debounced live
  typing detection is **[PLANNED]**.

- **Pattern Matching:** The extension must actively scan open Markdown (`.md`) files
  for the standard MkDocs snippet syntax:
  - **Single Line Format (DONE):**
    - `--8<-- "path/to/file.ext"` - entire file
    - `--8<-- "path/to/file.ext:name"` - named section
    - `--8<-- "path/to/file.ext:start:end"` - explicit line range
    - `--8<-- "path/to/file.ext:1:3,5:6"` - multiple line ranges
  - **Single Line Format (Planned v0.2.0+):**
    - `--8<-- "file.ext:5"` - from line 5 to end
    - `--8<-- "file.ext::10"` - from start to line 10
    - `--8<-- "file.ext:-5"` - last 5 lines (negative indexing)
    - `--8<-- "; disabled.md"` - disabled snippet (semicolon prefix)
    - `;--8<-- "escaped.md"` - escaped snippet syntax (shows literally)
    - `--8<-- "https://example.com/file.md"` - URL snippet
  - **Block Format (Planned v0.2.0+):**
    ```markdown
    --8<--
    file1.md
    file2.md
    ; disabled.md
    --8<--
    ```
  - **Examples:**

    ```markdown
    <!-- Include entire file (DONE) -->
    --8<-- "src/hello.py"
    --8<-- 'ch07/counter/counter.go'

    <!-- Include named section (DONE) -->
    --8<-- "src/example.py:func"
    --8<-- "config.yaml:database-config"

    <!-- Include specific line ranges (DONE) -->
    --8<-- "main.py:10:20"
    --8<-- "test.py:1:3,5:6"

    <!-- Advanced line ranges (PLANNED) -->
    --8<-- "utils.js:5"       # from line 5 to end
    --8<-- "readme.md::15"    # from start to line 15
    --8<-- "config.py:-10"    # last 10 lines

    <!-- Block format (PLANNED) -->
    --8<--
    file1.md
    file2.md:section
    --8<--
    ```

  - **Named Section Markers (DONE in v0.1.1):**
    - Defined in source files as `--8<-- [start:name]` and `--8<-- [end:name]`
    - Section name can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
    - Markers can be embedded in comments (e.g., `# --8<-- [start:func]` in Python)
    - Both start and end markers are required and matched by name
    - The lines containing the markers themselves are excluded from the snippet
  - **Line Number Ranges:**
    - **DONE in v0.1.1:**
      - `file.ext:5:10` - from line 5 to line 10 (explicit start and end)
      - `file.ext:1:3,5:6` - multiple ranges (lines 1-3 and 5-6)
    - **Planned for v0.2.0:**
      - `file.ext:5` - from line 5 to end of file
      - `file.ext::10` - from line 1 to line 10
      - `file.ext:-5` - last 5 lines (negative indexing)
      - `file.ext:-10:-1` - lines from 10th-last to last line
    - Line numbers are 1-based (0 is clamped to 1)
  - Must support both single quotes `'` and double quotes `"`.
  - Must handle relative paths (relative to the current file or a configured base).
- **Trigger Events:** Detection should occur:
  - On file open.
  - On file save.
  - (Optional) Debounced while typing (for immediate feedback).

### 2.2 Feature: Open Referenced File

- **[DONE]** Users can click the file path in the snippet syntax to open it (Document
  Link Provider).

- **Interaction:** Users must be able to click the file path within the snippet
  syntax to open it.
- **Implementation:** Utilize the **Document Link Provider** API.
  - The file path string (e.g., `"ch07/counter/counter.go"`) becomes a clickable
    link.
  - **Behavior:** Clicking opens the file in a new editor tab.

### 2.3 Feature: Content Preview ("Ghost Text")

- **[DONE]** Displays the contents of the referenced file below the snippet line as
  faded, italic ghost text. Limited to first 20 lines, with truncation indicator.
  Manual global toggle only (OFF by default). Per-snippet toggles, CodeLens, state
  persistence, recursive expansion, named sections, line ranges, and auto-refresh are
  **[PLANNED]**.

- **Visual Indicator:** Display the contents of the referenced file directly below
  the snippet line.
- **Style:** The text should appear as "ghost text" (faded/greyed out) to distinguish
  it from the actual source code of the markdown file.
- **Toggle Mechanisms:** Since snippet files can be large, previews should be
  toggleable rather than always on.
  - **Per-Snippet Toggle (CodeLens):** A clickable action above the line (e.g.,
    `$(eye) Show Snippet Content`) to toggle visibility of individual snippet
    previews.
  - **Per-Snippet Toggle (Keyboard):** Command "MkDocs Snippet Lens: Toggle Preview
    for Current Line" to toggle the preview for the snippet at the current cursor
    position.
  - **Global Toggle (Keyboard):** Command "MkDocs Snippet Lens: Toggle All Previews"
    with keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+K Cmd+S`) to show/hide all
    snippet previews in the current document at once.
- **State Management:**
  - Per-snippet toggle states should persist during the editing session.
  - Global toggle state should be remembered per-document or per-workspace based on
    the `mkdocsLens.defaultPreviewState` setting.
  - When global toggle is used, it should override individual per-snippet states.
- **Recursive Snippet Processing:** The preview must process nested snippet
  references the same way MkDocs does:
  - If a referenced file contains `--8<--` directives, those should be expanded
    recursively in the preview.
  - Maximum recursion depth of 100 levels to match MkDocs behavior.
- **Snippet Sections:** Support MkDocs snippet section syntax for partial file
  inclusion:
  - **Named Sections:** `--8<-- "file.ext:section_name"`
    - Sections are defined in source files using `--8<-- [start:name]` and `--8<--
      [end:name]`
    - Only the content between the markers is included (marker lines are excluded)
    - Section names are matched exactly
  - **Line Number Ranges:** `--8<-- "file.ext:start:end"`
    - Support single line to end: `file.ext:5`
    - Support start to line: `file.ext::10`
    - Support specific range: `file.ext:5:10`
    - Support multiple ranges: `file.ext:1:3,5:6`
    - Support negative indexes: `file.ext:-5` (last 5 lines)
    - Line numbers are 1-based
- **Circular Reference Handling:** If a circular reference is detected (file A
  includes file B which includes file A):
  - Stop processing at the point where the cycle is detected.
  - Display an error message in the preview indicating "Circular snippet reference
    detected" at the point where the cycle would occur.
  - This matches MkDocs behavior which prevents infinite loops.
- **Auto-Refresh on File Changes:** Preview content must automatically update when
  snippet files are modified:
  - Use VS Code's file watcher API (`workspace.createFileSystemWatcher`) to monitor
    referenced snippet files.
  - When a snippet file changes, invalidate the cache and re-render all previews that
    reference it (directly or through nested snippets).
  - Update should occur within 500ms of the file change being detected.
  - Handle the dependency chain: if file A includes file B includes file C, changes
    to C should refresh previews in both B and A.
  - Debounce rapid changes (same file modified multiple times in quick succession) to
    avoid excessive re-rendering.

### 2.4 Feature: Hover Tooltips

- **[DONE]** Hover tooltips for snippet content are implemented. When hovering over a
  snippet reference, a preview of the referenced file is shown, truncated to a
  configurable number of lines (default: 20). If the file is longer, a truncation
  message is displayed. Advanced formatting, section/range support, and error context
  are **[PLANNED]**.

Provide hover tooltips as an accessible alternative to ghost text decorations.

**Hover Provider Requirements:**

- **Trigger:** When user hovers over snippet reference (the entire `--8<--` line)
- **Content:** Display snippet content in hover tooltip
- **Formatting:**
  - Show file path as header (clickable link to open file)
  - Display snippet content with syntax highlighting matching file type
  - Show line count: "(showing X of Y lines)" if truncated
  - Respect `mkdocsLens.previewLines` setting for tooltip length
  - Indicate errors with message: "Cannot preview: [error message]"
- **Behavior:**
  - Load content on-demand (don't preload for all snippets)
  - Cache tooltip content using same cache as ghost text
  - Show loading indicator for slow operations (> 100ms)
  - Timeout after 2 seconds, show error message if content not loaded

**Accessibility:**

- Screen readers can access tooltip content via keyboard navigation
- Tooltip provides full snippet information even when ghost text is hidden
- Essential for users who disable ghost text decorations

**Example Tooltip Structure:**

```text
📄 src/example.py (click to open)
─────────────────────────────
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

(showing 3 of 50 lines)
```

**Error Tooltip Structure:**

```text
📄 src/missing.py
─────────────────────────────
⚠️ Cannot preview: Snippet file not found
```

### 2.5 Feature: Error Handling

- **[PARTIAL]** Diagnostic warnings (yellow squiggle) for file not found by default,
  with configurable severity via `strictMode` setting. Error message: "Snippet file
  not found: 'path/to/file'". Auto-detection of MkDocs `check_paths` setting,
  invalid path, permissions, section markers, unsaved file warnings, and recursive
  context are **[PLANNED]**.

All error conditions should prevent ghost text preview rendering and mark the file
path with a diagnostic underline (warning or error based on `strictMode`). Error
messages must include file and line number information, with full chain context for
recursive snippets. All error messages must be i18n-ready (see Section 4.5 for
detailed requirements).

#### 2.5.1 Missing Files

- **Visual Indicator:** Yellow squiggly underline (warning) by default, or red
  squiggly underline (error) if `strictMode` is configured for strict checking.
- **Diagnostic Severity:**
  - Determined by `mkdocsSnippetLens.strictMode` setting:
    - `"auto"` (default): Reads `check_paths` from `mkdocs.yml`
      - `check_paths: false` or unspecified → Warning (yellow)
      - `check_paths: true` → Error (red)
      - If `mkdocs.yml` not found → Warning (matches MkDocs default)
    - `"true"`: Always Error (red)
    - `"false"`: Always Warning (yellow)
- **Error/Warning Message:**
  - Warning format: "Snippet file not found: 'referenced_file' (snippet will be
    omitted by MkDocs) (in file.md:10)"
  - Error format: "Snippet file not found: 'referenced_file' (MkDocs build will fail
    with check_paths: true) (in file.md:10)"
  - For recursive snippets: Include full chain context

#### 2.5.2 Invalid Path Syntax

- **Condition:** File path contains invalid characters or malformed path components.
- **Visual Indicator:** Red squiggly underline on the file path.
- **Error Message:**
  - Format: "Invalid file path syntax (in file.md:10)"
  - For recursive snippets: Include the full chain: "Invalid file path syntax (in
    parent_file.md:15 via root_file.md:5)"

#### 2.5.3 Permission Denied

- **Condition:** File exists but cannot be read due to permission issues.
- **Visual Indicator:** Red squiggly underline on the file path.
- **Error Message:**
  - Format: "Permission denied: cannot read snippet file 'referenced_file' (in
    file.md:10)"
  - For recursive snippets: Include the full chain.

#### 2.5.4 Invalid Section Specification

- **Condition:** Snippet section markers are specified but not found in the
  referenced file, OR line numbers are out of range.
- **Visual Indicator:** Yellow squiggly underline (warning) by default, or red
  squiggly underline (error) if `strictMode` is configured for strict checking.
- **Diagnostic Severity:** Determined by `mkdocsSnippetLens.strictMode` setting
  (same logic as §2.5.1)
- **Error/Warning Message:**
  - Warning format for named sections: "Section 'name' not found in 'referenced_file'
    (snippet will be omitted by MkDocs) (in file.md:10)"
  - Error format for named sections: "Section 'name' not found in 'referenced_file'
    (MkDocs build will fail with check_paths: true) (in file.md:10)"
  - Warning format for line numbers: "Line range out of bounds in 'referenced_file':
    lines X:Y exceed file length N (snippet will be omitted by MkDocs) (in
    file.md:10)"
  - Error format for line numbers: "Line range out of bounds in 'referenced_file':
    lines X:Y exceed file length N (MkDocs build will fail with check_paths: true)
    (in file.md:10)"
  - Include actual marker names/line numbers and file/line information.
  - For recursive snippets: Include the full chain.
- **Note:** If a named section's start or end marker is missing, severity is
  determined by `strictMode` setting.

#### 2.5.5 Unsaved File with Relative Paths

- **Condition:** Markdown file is unsaved (untitled) and contains relative snippet
  paths.
- **Visual Indicator:** Yellow squiggly underline (warning) on the file path.
- **Warning Message:**
  - Format: "Relative snippet paths in unsaved files resolve relative to workspace
    root. Save the file for accurate path resolution (in {filename})"
  - Where {filename} is the untitled filename (e.g., "Untitled-1")
- **Behavior:**
  - This is a warning, not an error - snippets may still work if resolvable from
    workspace root
  - If path cannot be resolved even from workspace root, show error diagnostic
    instead (2.4.1)

### 2.6 Feature: Command Palette Commands

- **[PARTIAL]** Global toggle command: "MkDocs Snippet Lens: Toggle All Previews". Other
  commands (per-snippet toggle, navigation, copy, open to side, clear cache, output

#### 2.6.4 Context Keys

To support conditional command availability, the extension must set the following
context keys:

- `mkdocsLens:hasSnippetAtCursor` - Boolean, true when cursor is on a line containing
  a snippet reference
- `mkdocsLens:hasSnippets` - Boolean, true when the current document contains any
  snippet references
- `mkdocsLens:previewsVisible` - Boolean, true when any previews are currently
  visible

**Implementation Notes:**

- Context keys must be updated when document changes or cursor moves
- Use `vscode.commands.executeCommand('setContext', key, value)` to update
- Debounce cursor position updates to avoid performance issues

#### 2.6.5 Keybinding Strategy

**Default Keybindings:**

- No default keybindings should be set initially to avoid conflicts with other
  extensions
- Document **suggested** keybindings in README for users to configure
- After v1.0, consider adding default keybindings for most-used commands based on
  user feedback

**Keybinding Configuration (if defaults are added):**

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+p",
  "mac": "cmd+alt+p",
  "command": "mkdocsLens.toggleAllPreviews",
  "when": "editorLangId == markdown"
}
```

**Requirements:**

- All keybindings must respect the `when` clause to only activate in appropriate
  contexts
- Mac-specific keybindings must use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`
- Must not override common VS Code or popular extension keybindings

#### 2.6.6 Command Implementation Requirements

**Registration:**

- All commands must be registered in the `activate()` function
- Commands must be added to `context.subscriptions` for proper disposal
- Command IDs in code must match IDs in `package.json` `contributes.commands`

**Error Handling:**

- Commands must not throw unhandled errors
- Show user-friendly error messages via `window.showErrorMessage()` if operation
  fails
- Log detailed errors to output channel for troubleshooting

**Feedback:**

- Commands that modify state should provide visual feedback (status bar message,
  etc.)
- Long-running commands should show progress indicators
- Commands should complete quickly (< 200ms perceived response time)

**Accessibility:**

- All commands must be keyboard accessible
- Command titles must be descriptive and screen-reader friendly
- Avoid icons-only in command labels

## 3. Configuration Settings

- **[PARTIAL]** `mkdocsSnippetLens.basePath`, `mkdocsSnippetLens.previewMaxLines`,
  `mkdocsSnippetLens.previewMaxChars`, and `mkdocsSnippetLens.strictMode` with
  auto-detection of MkDocs configuration are implemented. Other settings and full
  validation are **[PLANNED]**.

- `mkdocsSnippetLens.strictMode`: (String enum) Control diagnostic severity for
  missing snippets and invalid sections.
  - *Options:* `"auto"`, `"true"`, `"false"`
  - *Default:* `"auto"`
  - `"auto"`: Automatically detect from `mkdocs.yml` if present in workspace root
    - Reads `markdown_extensions` → `pymdownx.snippets` → `check_paths` setting
    - `check_paths: false` or unspecified → Warnings (yellow squiggles)
    - `check_paths: true` → Errors (red squiggles)
    - If `mkdocs.yml` not found or parse fails → Warnings (matches MkDocs default)
    - Supports both `mkdocs.yml` and `mkdocs.yaml` filenames
  - `"true"`: Always show errors (red squiggles) for missing/invalid snippets
  - `"false"`: Always show warnings (yellow squiggles) for missing/invalid snippets
  - *Implementation Notes:*
    - Requires YAML parser (e.g., `js-yaml` dependency)
    - Config file is read on extension activation and when modified
    - Uses file system watcher to detect `mkdocs.yml` changes
    - For multi-root workspaces, reads config from workspace folder containing the
      current markdown file
    - Parse errors are logged to output channel and fall back to warnings

- `mkdocsLens.basePath`: (String) The root directory to resolve snippet paths
  against.
  - *Default:* `${workspaceFolder}`
  - *Option:* `${fileDirname}` (relative to the current markdown file).

- `mkdocsLens.previewLines`: (Number) Limit the number of lines shown in the ghost
  text preview to prevent massive files from cluttering the view (e.g., default to 20
  lines).

- `mkdocsLens.defaultPreviewState`: (String) Control the default state of snippet
  previews when opening a file.
  - *Options:* `"on"`, `"off"`, `"remember"`
  - *Default:* `"off"`
  - `"on"`: All previews are shown by default
  - `"off"`: All previews are hidden by default
  - `"remember"`: Remember the last global toggle state per-document or per-workspace

- `mkdocsLens.maxFileSize`: (Number) Maximum file size in bytes for snippet previews.
  - *Default:* `1048576` (1MB)
  - Files exceeding this limit will show a truncation warning instead of content

- `mkdocsLens.maxPreviewCount`: (Number) Maximum number of visible previews at once.
  - *Default:* `50`
  - Prevents performance degradation with many snippets in a single file

- `mkdocsLens.debounceDelay`: (Number) Milliseconds to wait before updating previews
  while typing.
  - *Default:* `300`
  - Range: 100-1000ms

- `mkdocsLens.enablePathTraversalProtection`: (Boolean) Prevent snippet paths from
  accessing files outside the workspace.
  - *Default:* `true`
  - When enabled, paths like `../../etc/passwd` will be rejected with an error

- `mkdocsLens.followSymlinks`: (Boolean) Follow symbolic links when resolving snippet
  paths.
  - *Default:* `true`
  - When `false`, symlinks are treated as errors
  - Useful for high-security environments where symlinks are not expected

### 3.1 Configuration Validation

All configuration settings must be validated to prevent extension errors and provide
clear feedback to users.

**Validation Rules:**

- **`mkdocsLens.basePath`:**
  - Must be a valid string containing a path or VS Code variable
  - Supported variables: `${workspaceFolder}`, `${fileDirname}`
  - If path doesn't exist or is inaccessible, show warning notification and fall back
    to `${workspaceFolder}`
  - Empty string or null values default to `${workspaceFolder}`

- **`mkdocsLens.previewLines`:**
  - Must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000
  - Invalid values (negative, zero, non-numeric, > 1000) default to 20
  - Show warning in output channel for invalid values

- **`mkdocsLens.defaultPreviewState`:**
  - Must be one of: `"on"`, `"off"`, `"remember"`
  - Invalid values default to `"off"`
  - Show warning in output channel for invalid values

- **`mkdocsLens.maxFileSize`:**
  - Must be a positive integer (bytes)
  - Minimum: 1024 (1KB), Maximum: 10485760 (10MB)
  - Invalid values default to 1048576 (1MB)
  - Show warning in output channel for invalid values

- **`mkdocsLens.maxPreviewCount`:**
  - Must be a positive integer between 1 and 500
  - Invalid values default to 50
  - Show warning in output channel for invalid values

- **`mkdocsLens.debounceDelay`:**
  - Must be an integer between 100 and 1000 (milliseconds)
  - Invalid values default to 300
  - Show warning in output channel for invalid values

- **Boolean Settings:**
  - `mkdocsLens.enablePathTraversalProtection`
  - `mkdocsLens.followSymlinks`
  - Non-boolean values default to documented default value
  - Show warning in output channel for invalid values

**Configuration Change Handling:**

- **Immediate Effect:** Changes to boolean flags and numeric limits take effect
  immediately
- **Requires Reprocessing:** Changes to `basePath` trigger re-processing of all open
  markdown files
- **User Notification:** Changes affecting active previews show status bar message:
  "MkDocs Snippet Lens: Configuration updated"
- **Error Recovery:** Invalid configuration never crashes extension; always falls
  back to safe defaults

**Validation Timing:**

- Validate on extension activation
- Validate when configuration changes (`workspace.onDidChangeConfiguration`)
- Validate before each use (defensive programming for runtime type changes)

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **[PARTIAL]** Extension works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. No telemetry. Path
  traversal protection, symlink handling, file size/resource limits, and i18n are
  **[PLANNED]**.

### 4.1 Platform & Environment

- **Minimum VS Code Version:** 1.85.0 (November 2023)
  - Rationale: Requires stable Text Decorations API and modern TypeScript support

- **Supported Platforms:**
  - Windows 10/11
  - macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later
  - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ or equivalent)

- **Maximum Workspace Size:** No hard limit, but performance optimized for:
  - Up to 10,000 markdown files
  - Individual files up to 10MB (though snippet preview limited to 1MB)
  - Up to 100 concurrent snippet references per file

### 4.2 Security Requirements

- **Path Traversal Protection:**
  - **Objective:** Prevent snippet paths from accessing files outside the workspace
    while allowing legitimate cross-folder references within the workspace (e.g.,
    docs referencing source code in `src/`).
  - **Allowed Paths:**
    - Any absolute or relative path that resolves to a file within the workspace
      folder
    - Paths are resolved using `workspace.getWorkspaceFolder()` to determine the
      workspace boundary
    - Symbolic links are resolved (see Symlink Handling below), and the final
      resolved path must be within the workspace
  - **Blocked Paths:**
    - Any path that resolves outside the workspace folder (e.g.,
      `../../../etc/passwd`)
    - Paths containing null bytes or other filesystem attack vectors
    - When `mkdocsLens.enablePathTraversalProtection` is `true` (default), external
      paths are blocked with an error
    - When `mkdocsLens.enablePathTraversalProtection` is `false`, external paths are
      allowed but show a warning diagnostic
  - **Error Handling:**
    - Display diagnostic error: "Snippet path resolves outside workspace:
      '/resolved/absolute/path' (in file.md:10)"
    - Red squiggly underline on the file path
    - For recursive snippets, include the full chain context
  - **Logging:**
    - Log all blocked path attempts to the extension's output channel
    - Include the original path, resolved path, and workspace root for debugging
    - Format: `[Security] Blocked path outside workspace: 'original/path' resolved to
      '/absolute/path' (workspace: '/workspace/root')`

- **Symlink Handling:**
  - **Strategy:** Resolve symlinks with strict security validation to support
    legitimate development workflows while preventing security exploits.
  - **Resolution Process:**
    - Use Node's `fs.realpath()` or VS Code's equivalent to resolve symlinks to their
      final target
    - Resolves the entire path, including intermediate symlinks
    - Final resolved path must point to an actual file (not another symlink)
  - **Security Validation:**
    - After resolution, check that the final absolute path is within the workspace
      boundary
    - Use normalized, absolute paths for comparison (handles `.`, `..`, case
      sensitivity)
    - If resolved path is outside workspace and
      `mkdocsLens.enablePathTraversalProtection` is `true`, block with error
    - If protection is `false`, allow but show warning diagnostic
  - **Attack Prevention:**
    - **Loop detection:** Detect circular symlinks (A → B → A) and fail with error
    - **Depth limit:** Maximum 40 symlink resolution levels (matches Linux kernel
      limit)
    - **Race condition protection:** Validate path existence and permissions after
      resolution
  - **Platform Considerations:**
    - **Windows:** Also handle junction points and directory symlinks using same
      logic
    - **macOS/Linux:** Handle both file and directory symlinks
    - **All platforms:** Hard links are transparent (appear as regular files), no
      special handling needed
  - **Error Messages:**
    - Circular symlink: "Symlink loop detected in snippet path '{path}' (in
      file.md:10)"
    - Depth exceeded: "Symlink resolution depth exceeded for '{path}' (in
      file.md:10)"
    - Outside workspace: "Snippet path resolves outside workspace via symlink:
      '{original}' → '{resolved}' (in file.md:10)"
    - Broken symlink: "Snippet file not found: '{path}' (in file.md:10)" (same as
      missing file)
    - Dangling symlink: "Cannot resolve symlink in '{path}' (in file.md:10)"
  - **Logging:**
    - Log all symlink resolutions to output channel (debug level)
    - Format: `[Path Resolution] Symlink resolved: 'original/path' →
      '/absolute/resolved/path'`
    - Format for blocked: `[Security] Blocked symlink outside workspace:
      'original/path' → '/resolved/path' (workspace: '/workspace/root')`
  - **Optional Configuration:**
    - Setting: `mkdocsLens.followSymlinks` (boolean, default `true`)
    - When `false`, treat symlinks as errors instead of following them
    - Useful for high-security environments where symlinks are not expected

- **File Size Limits:**
  - Prevent DOS attacks from extremely large snippet files
  - Default 1MB limit for previews (configurable via `mkdocsLens.maxFileSize`)
  - Display warning message for files exceeding limit instead of loading content
  - Enforce timeout on file read operations (5 seconds max)

- **Resource Consumption:**
  - Limit maximum concurrent file I/O operations to 10
  - Implement cancellation tokens for all async operations
  - Release resources immediately when editors are closed
  - Prevent unbounded memory growth through proper cache invalidation

- **Privilege Model:**
  - Extension requires only file system read access
  - No write access to any files
  - No network access required (all operations are local)

- **Privacy and Telemetry:**
  - **No telemetry or analytics collection** - The extension collects no usage data
  - **No network requests** - All operations are performed locally within the
    workspace
  - **No user tracking** - No identifiers, metrics, or behavioral data collected
  - **No external services** - Extension does not communicate with any external
    servers
  - **Privacy guarantee** - User data never leaves the local machine
  - **Rationale:** Builds user trust, simplifies compliance (GDPR), reduces
    maintenance burden
  - **Note:** Extension updates are handled by VS Code Marketplace (standard for all
    extensions)

### 4.3 Reliability Requirements

- **Error Recovery:**
  - Extension must not crash VS Code under any error condition
  - Gracefully handle and log unexpected errors
  - Provide clear error messages to users without exposing sensitive paths

- **Data Integrity:**
  - Read-only access ensures no accidental file modifications
  - Preview decorations never modify the actual markdown content
  - State persistence uses VS Code's storage APIs only

### 4.4 Internationalization (i18n)

- **Message Externalization:**
  - All user-facing strings must be externalized for translation
  - Use VS Code's `vscode-nls` package for message localization
  - Error messages, status messages, command labels, and setting descriptions must be
    localizable
  - No hardcoded user-facing strings in code

- **Message Keys:**
  - Use descriptive message keys (e.g., `error.snippetNotFound` instead of `err1`)
  - Organize keys by feature/component for maintainability
  - Include context comments for translators in message bundle files

- **String Formatting:**
  - Use parameterized messages for dynamic content (file names, line numbers, etc.)
  - Example: `"Snippet file not found: '{0}' (in {1}:{2})"` where `{0}` = filename,
    `{1}` = source file, `{2}` = line number
  - Avoid string concatenation that assumes English grammar/word order
  - Support plural forms where applicable

- **Initial Language Support:**
  - English (en) as the default/base language
  - Additional languages are out of scope for initial version but infrastructure must
    support future additions
  - All strings in `package.nls.json` for easy extraction

- **i18n Best Practices:**
  - Avoid assumptions about text direction (LTR/RTL)
  - Don't hardcode punctuation in concatenated strings
  - Keep messages concise but informative
  - Use complete sentences rather than fragments for better translation context

- **Testing:**
  - Verify all user-facing strings use localization functions
  - Test with pseudo-localization to ensure UI accommodates longer strings
  - Ensure no text is truncated when using different languages

### 4.5 Memory Usage Limits

- **Maximum Memory Footprint:**
  - Target: < 50MB for typical usage (10-20 open files with snippets)
  - Ceiling: < 200MB even with maximum configured limits

- **Cache Management:**
  - Cache snippet content with LRU eviction policy
  - Maximum cache size: 100 entries or 10MB, whichever is smaller
  - Invalidate cache entries when source files change
  - Clear all caches when workspace folder changes

- **Decoration Limits:**
  - Dispose decorations immediately when toggled off
  - Limit decoration content to configured `mkdocsLens.previewLines`
  - Reuse decoration types instead of creating new ones per line

## 5. Technical Specifications & Constraints

- **[PARTIAL]** Uses Text Decorations API for ghost text. Path resolution precedence is
  implemented as described. Multi-root workspace support, async loading, advanced
  performance/resource management, and accessibility enhancements are **[PLANNED]**.

### 5.1 "Ghost Text" Implementation Strategy

*Note on Feasibility:* After extensive investigation (see implementation spike), VS
Code currently only supports single line decoration previews using the `after`
property. Multi-line ghost text blocks (true block-style previews) are not possible
with the current API, even if `contentText` contains newlines. Each snippet preview
is therefore rendered as a single (potentially long) line. Block-style previews are
deferred until VS Code supports this capability.

#### 5.1.1 Ghost Text Styling

Use theme-aware colors that adapt to the user's color theme:

- **Color Options (in order of preference):**
  1. `editorGhostText.foreground` - Designed specifically for inline suggestions
  2. `editorCodeLens.foreground` - Used for CodeLens (typically faded)
  3. `descriptionForeground` - Used for secondary/descriptive text
  4. `editor.foreground` with opacity 0.4-0.6

- **Font Style:** Use `italic` to distinguish ghost text from actual markdown content

- **Opacity:** 40-60% (0.4-0.6) works well across most themes if using opacity-based
  approach

- **Optional Enhancements:**
  - Font size: Slightly smaller (0.9-0.95em) for subtle distinction
  - Border: Subtle left border (2px) using theme color to visually separate from
    markdown
  - Margin: Small left margin (1em) for indentation

- **Example Implementation:**

  ```typescript
  const ghostTextDecoration = window.createTextEditorDecorationType({
    after: {
      color: new vscode.ThemeColor('editorCodeLens.foreground'),
      fontStyle: 'italic',
      textDecoration: 'none; font-size: 0.95em;',
      borderLeft: '2px solid',
      borderColor: new vscode.ThemeColor('editorCodeLens.foreground'),
      margin: '0 0 0 1em'
    }
  });
  ```

- **Avoid:**
  - Hardcoded colors (e.g., `#808080`) - won't work with all themes
  - Too low opacity (< 30%) - difficult to read
  - Too high opacity (> 70%) - confuses with actual code

#### 5.1.2 Decoration Interaction with Other Extensions

VS Code's decoration API composites multiple decorations without conflicts. This
extension's ghost text won't interfere with other extensions.

- **No special handling needed:** After-decorations don't modify actual text, just
  add visual content below the line.
- **Visual clutter mitigation:** Keep decorations subtle (faded, italic) and respect
  configured `previewLines` limit.
- **User control:** Toggle functionality allows users to hide previews if
  experiencing visual overload.
- **Expected compatibility:**
  - Linters (ESLint, Markdownlint) - use different decoration ranges
  - Git decorations - appear in gutter, not inline
  - Other preview extensions - typically use hovers or separate panels
- **Edge case:** Multiple extensions adding after-line decorations to the same line
  will stack vertically (expected VS Code behavior).

### 5.2 Path Resolution Logic

1. Check if the path is absolute.
2. If relative, attempt to resolve relative to the **current file**.
3. If not found, attempt to resolve relative to the **workspace root** (or configured
    `basePath`).

#### 5.2.1 Untitled/Unsaved File Handling

Untitled files (e.g., `Untitled-1`) don't have a file path on disk, which affects
relative path resolution.

- **Detection:** Check if `document.uri.scheme === 'untitled'`
- **Path resolution for untitled files:**
  - **Absolute paths:** Process normally - these work regardless of current file
    location
  - **Relative paths:**
    - Skip "relative to current file" resolution step (no current file path exists)
    - Only attempt resolution relative to workspace root / configured `basePath`
    - If no workspace folder is available, show diagnostic error
- **User feedback:**
  - Show **warning diagnostic** (yellow squiggle) on snippets with relative paths in
    untitled files
  - Message: "Relative snippet paths in unsaved files resolve relative to workspace
    root. Save the file for accurate path resolution (in {filename})"
  - This informs users but doesn't block functionality
- **Documentation:**
  - README should note: "For best results with relative snippet paths, save your
    markdown file first"
  - Include in hover tooltip for the warning

### 5.3 Multi-Root Workspace Support

**Scope:** Multi-root workspace support is **out of scope** for the initial version
of this extension.

**Behavior:**

- The extension will work with the workspace folder containing the current markdown
  document.
- Use `workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(documentUri)` to determine the workspace folder
  for path resolution.
- Each workspace folder will be treated independently (no cross-folder snippet
  references).

**Future Enhancement:**

- Full multi-root workspace support, including cross-folder references and
  folder-specific configuration, is planned for a future version.
- This approach ensures the extension works correctly in multi-root workspaces while
  deferring advanced features.

### 5.4 Performance Requirements

- **Responsiveness:**
  - Extension operations must not block typing or UI interactions.
  - Target: < 50ms for synchronous operations, < 200ms for user-perceived actions.

- **File Size Limits:**
  - Set maximum file size for snippet previews (default: 1MB).
  - Display warning or truncate content for files exceeding the limit.
  - Prevent memory issues from loading extremely large files.

- **Debouncing:**
  - If detecting snippets while typing, debounce updates (300-500ms).
  - Only process the active editor, not all open files simultaneously.

- **Async Operations:**
  - All file I/O operations must be asynchronous (use `workspace.fs.readFile`).
  - Use cancellation tokens for long-running operations.
  - Allow users to continue working while previews load in the background.

- **Resource Management:**
  - Limit concurrent snippet previews (e.g., max 50 visible previews at once).
  - Dispose decorations when editors are closed to prevent memory leaks.
  - Clear caches periodically with appropriate invalidation strategy.

- **Activation Time:**
  - Extension should activate in < 500ms.
  - Use specific activation events (`onLanguage:markdown`) rather than `*`.
  - Lazy-load features only when needed.

- **Incremental Updates:**
  - Only re-process changed portions of the document.
  - Cache resolved file paths and content with proper invalidation.
  - Update decorations incrementally, not all at once.

### 5.4.1 Performance Degradation and Graceful Failure

Define specific behaviors when system limits are approached or exceeded.

**When Snippet Count Exceeds Limits:**

- **Configured Limit (`mkdocsLens.maxPreviewCount`):**
  - Show warning diagnostic on first snippet beyond limit
  - Message: "Preview limit reached (X/Y). Increase mkdocsLens.maxPreviewCount or
    toggle off some previews."
  - Disable CodeLens "Show" action for snippets beyond limit
  - Show limit status in hover tooltip
  - Still allow clicking links to open files

- **Hard Limit (500 snippets per file):**
  - Show error notification once per file
  - Message: "Too many snippets in this file (X found). Only first 500 will be
    processed."
  - Log warning to output channel
  - Disable preview features but maintain document link functionality

**When File Size Exceeds Limits:**

- **Preview warning (> 100KB):**
  - Show truncation indicator in preview: "... (content truncated, file is X KB)"
  - Display full size in hover tooltip with warning icon
  - Offer "Open in Editor" button in CodeLens

- **Preview disabled (> maxFileSize):**
  - Show diagnostic warning on snippet line
  - Message: "Preview disabled: file exceeds size limit (X MB > Y MB)"
  - Hover tooltip shows file info and limit
  - Link still works to open file

**File Watcher Resource Limits:**

- **OS Limit Approached:**
  - Detect when approaching platform limits (e.g., Linux inotify limit)
  - Show warning notification: "File watcher limit reached. Auto-refresh disabled for
    some files."
  - Log affected files to output channel
  - Prioritize watching files in active editor

- **Watcher Creation Fails:**
  - Silently disable auto-refresh for that file
  - Log error to output channel
  - Manual refresh still works via command

**Large Workspace Handling:**

- **Workspace Size Check:**
  - Count markdown files on first activation
  - If > 10,000 files, show info notification: "Large workspace detected. Some
    features may be slower."
  - Increase debounce delays automatically (+100ms)
  - Limit concurrent processing to 5 files

**System Under Load:**

- **CPU/Memory Pressure:**
  - Detect slow operations (> 2x normal time)
  - Increase debounce delays dynamically
  - Reduce cache size temporarily
  - Log performance degradation to output channel

**Network File Systems:**

- **Slow I/O Detection:**
  - Timeout file reads after 5 seconds
  - Show warning: "Snippet file load timeout (network drive?)"
  - Suggest increasing `maxFileSize` or using local files
  - Cache aggressively to reduce repeated reads

**Recovery Actions:**

- All degraded states automatically recover when conditions improve
- User can manually trigger "Clear Cache and Refresh" command to reset
- Extension never crashes; falls back to basic functionality (links only)

### 5.5 Extension Activation

**Activation Event:** `onLanguage:markdown`

**Rationale:**

- Extension only provides value for Markdown files
- Enables lazy loading - only activates when user opens a `.md` file
- Standard pattern for language-specific extensions
- Good performance - doesn't activate unnecessarily on workspace open

**Configuration in package.json:**

```json
{
  "activationEvents": [
    "onLanguage:markdown"
  ]
}
```

**Behavior:**

- Extension activates when user opens any Markdown (`.md`) file
- Remains dormant if no Markdown files are opened
- All providers (DocumentLink, CodeLens, Diagnostics, Decorations) require extension
  to be active
- Commands are automatically available via `onCommand` activation (inferred from
  `contributes.commands` in package.json)

**Performance Target:**

- Activation time: < 500ms (measured from activation event to ready state)
- No blocking operations during activation
- Lazy initialization of heavy components (cache, file watchers) until first use

**What NOT to use:**

- `"*"` (activate on startup) - Wasteful, extension provides no value without
  markdown files
- `"onStartupFinished"` - Delays functionality unnecessarily
- `"workspaceContains:**/*.md"` - Activates too early on workspace load

**Testing Requirements:**

- Verify extension doesn't activate on workspace open without markdown files
- Verify extension activates when first markdown file is opened
- Verify activation time is within 500ms budget
- Test command availability before and after activation
- Measure memory footprint after activation

#### 5.5.1 Extension Lifecycle and Resource Management

Define requirements for extension activation, deactivation, and resource cleanup.

**Activation (`activate()` function):**

- **Registration:**
  - Register all providers (DocumentLink, CodeLens, Diagnostics, Decorations)
  - Register all commands
  - Add all disposables to `context.subscriptions` array for automatic cleanup
  - Initialize output channel and add to subscriptions

- **State Initialization:**
  - Load persisted state from workspace/global storage
  - Validate configuration settings
  - Initialize empty caches (don't preload data)
  - Set up configuration change listeners

- **Event Listeners:**
  - Document open/close events
  - Document change events (with debouncing)
  - Configuration change events
  - Workspace folder change events
  - All listeners must be added to `context.subscriptions`

- **Timing:**
  - Complete within 500ms
  - No synchronous file I/O during activation
  - No network requests
  - Defer heavy operations until first document opened

**Deactivation (`deactivate()` function):**

- **Resource Cleanup:**
  - Dispose all decoration types
  - Cancel all pending file operations (use cancellation tokens)
  - Clear all caches to free memory
  - Dispose all file watchers
  - Remove all diagnostics
  - Close output channel

- **State Persistence:**
  - Save current preview visibility state (if `defaultPreviewState: "remember"`)
  - Save per-document toggle states for restore on next session
  - Don't save cache data (regenerate on activation)

- **Timing:**
  - Complete within 1000ms
  - Don't block VS Code shutdown
  - Log deactivation to output channel (if still available)

**Error Handling:**

- Both `activate()` and `deactivate()` must never throw unhandled errors
- Catch and log all errors to output channel
- Extension failure should not crash VS Code
- Show error notification to user if activation fails critically

**Disposal Pattern:**

All resources that require cleanup must implement or use disposables:

```typescript
// Register disposable resources
context.subscriptions.push(
  decorationType,
  diagnosticCollection,
  fileWatcher,
  documentLinkProvider,
  codeLensProvider,
  hoverProvider,
  vscode.workspace.onDidChangeConfiguration(handler),
  vscode.workspace.onDidOpenTextDocument(handler),
  vscode.workspace.onDidCloseTextDocument(handler),
  vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument(handler)
);
```

**Resource Limits:**

- Maximum file watchers: 100 concurrent (dispose oldest if exceeded)
- Maximum cache entries: 100 items
- Maximum decoration types: 1 (reuse across all snippet lines)
- Maximum diagnostics per file: 500

#### 5.5.2 Workspace State Persistence

Define what state persists across VS Code sessions and how it's managed.

**State Categories:**

**1. Per-Workspace State (survives restarts, workspace-specific):**

- Individual snippet preview visibility (which snippets are toggled on/off)
- Last global toggle state (all on vs all off) if `defaultPreviewState: "remember"`
- User's preferred base path if customized per-workspace
- Cached file watcher warnings (don't re-warn about same limits)

**2. Global State (survives restarts, applies to all workspaces):**

- Extension enabled/disabled state
- User's global preferences (if we add global settings in future)
- First-run flag (for showing welcome message, if implemented)

**3. Session-Only State (lost on reload):**

- Cached snippet content (must be regenerated)
- Resolved file paths (must be re-resolved)
- File system watchers (must be recreated)
- Decoration instances (must be recreated)

**Storage API Usage:**

```typescript
// Workspace state (workspace-specific)
context.workspaceState.update('snippetToggles', toggleStates);
const toggles = context.workspaceState.get('snippetToggles', {});

// Global state (applies everywhere)
context.globalState.update('extensionEnabled', true);
const enabled = context.globalState.get('extensionEnabled', true);
```

**State Structure:**

```typescript
// Per-snippet toggle state (workspace state)
interface SnippetToggleState {
  [documentUri: string]: {
    [lineNumber: number]: boolean; // true = visible, false = hidden
  };
}

// Global toggle state per document (workspace state)
interface GlobalToggleState {
  [documentUri: string]: boolean; // true = all visible, false = all hidden
}
```

**State Synchronization:**

- Save state when snippets are toggled (debounced, max once per second)
- Save state on document close
- Save state on extension deactivation
- Load state on extension activation
- Load state when document is opened

**State Cleanup:**

- Remove state for closed documents after 30 days (prevent unbounded growth)
- Provide "Clear All Cached States" command for user control
- Automatically remove invalid state entries (malformed data)

**State Migration:**

- If state format changes between versions, migrate gracefully
- Log migration events to output channel
- Fall back to defaults if migration fails
- Never crash on invalid state data

**Privacy:**

- State storage is local only (VS Code's storage API)
- No state sent to external servers
- State files located in VS Code's extension storage folder
- Can be cleared by uninstalling extension

### 5.6 Accessibility Requirements

#### 5.6.1 Visual Accessibility

- **High Contrast Mode Support:**
  - Use VS Code theme colors (`ThemeColor`) to automatically adapt to high contrast
    themes.
  - Test extension in high contrast dark and light themes.
  - Ensure ghost text maintains sufficient contrast and readability.
  - Verify error underlines are visible in high contrast mode.

- **Color Blindness:**
  - Do not rely solely on color (red underlines) to convey errors.
  - Include descriptive text-based error messages in diagnostics (already specified).
  - CodeLens icons should include text labels, not just color indicators.

- **Low Vision:**
  - Ghost text must respect user's font size settings.
  - Ensure sufficient contrast ratio (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large
    text).
  - Minimum ghost text size should not be smaller than 0.9em.

#### 5.6.2 Screen Reader Support

- **Hover Provider for Snippet Content:**
  - Implement a hover provider that shows snippet content in a tooltip.
  - This provides an accessible alternative to ghost text decorations, which are not
    read by screen readers.
  - Screen readers can access hover tooltips via keyboard navigation.

- **Diagnostics Accessibility:**
  - Error messages are automatically accessible via the Problems panel (VS Code
    handles this).
  - Screen readers announce diagnostics when the cursor moves to affected lines.

- **CodeLens Accessibility:**
  - CodeLens commands are keyboard accessible and readable by screen readers (VS Code
    handles this).
  - Use descriptive labels: "Show snippet content" not just "Show".

- **Alternative Command:**
  - Provide a command "MkDocs Snippet Lens: Copy Snippet Content to Output" that
    copies snippet content to the Output panel.
  - This provides another accessible way for screen reader users to review snippet
    content.

#### 5.6.3 Keyboard Navigation

- **Full Keyboard Access:**
  - All extension features must be accessible without a mouse.
  - Toggle commands available via keyboard shortcuts.
  - Document links work with Enter key (VS Code handles this automatically).
  - Tab navigation works naturally through UI elements.

- **Focus Management:**
  - When opening referenced files, focus moves to the opened file (VS Code default).
  - When toggling previews, focus remains on the current line.
  - No unexpected focus changes.

#### 5.6.4 Status Announcements

- **Toggle State Announcements:**
  - Display status bar message when toggling previews globally:
    - "All snippet previews shown"
    - "All snippet previews hidden"
  - Provides feedback for users who cannot see the visual changes.

#### 5.6.5 Cognitive Accessibility

- **Clear Visual Distinction:**
  - Ghost text must be clearly distinguishable from actual markdown content (italic,
    faded styling).
  - Limit default preview length to reduce cognitive load (20 lines default).
  - Use clear, descriptive error messages with actionable information.

- **Consistent Naming:**
  - Use consistent command and setting names throughout the extension.
  - Provide clear descriptions for all settings.
  - Use sensible defaults to minimize configuration needs.

#### 5.6.6 Motion and Animation

- **Reduce Motion:**
  - Do not use animations when showing/hiding previews.
  - Instant show/hide rather than fade effects.
  - Respect user's motion preferences (no unnecessary transitions).

#### 5.6.7 Testing Requirements

- **Screen Reader Testing:**
  - Test with NVDA or JAWS on Windows.
  - Test with VoiceOver on macOS.
  - Verify all features are accessible and announced properly.

- **High Contrast Testing:**
  - Test in "Dark High Contrast" theme.
  - Test in "Light High Contrast" theme.
  - Verify all visual elements are visible and distinguishable.

- **Keyboard-Only Testing:**
  - Perform complete workflow using only keyboard.
  - Verify all commands are reachable via keyboard shortcuts or command palette.

## 6. User Stories

- **[PARTIAL]**
  1. Click filename in snippet reference to open file.
  2. See code being snipped inline (ghost text).
  3. Preview is read-only and faded.

- **[PLANNED]**
  - All other user stories requiring advanced features (sections, ranges, recursion,
    accessibility, etc.).

1. **As a** technical writer, **I want** to click the filename in a snippet
   reference, **So that** I can quickly edit the source code without manually
   searching the file explorer.

2. **As a** reviewer, **I want** to see the code being snipped inline (ghost text),
   **So that** I can verify the context is correct without opening a new tab.

3. **As a** developer, **I want** the preview to be read-only and faded, **So that**
   I don't mistakenly try to edit the preview text thinking it is part of the
   markdown file.

```typescript
/**
 * Resolves a snippet file path relative to the current document or workspace.
 *
 * @param snippetPath - The path from the snippet reference (may be relative or absolute)
 * @param documentUri - URI of the markdown document containing the snippet
 * @returns Resolved absolute URI of the snippet file
 * @throws {Error} If path resolves outside workspace (when protection enabled)
 *
 * @example
 * // Relative path
 * resolvePath("../src/example.py", documentUri)
 *
 * // Absolute path
 * resolvePath("/home/user/docs/snippet.txt", documentUri)

## 8. Testing Requirements

- **[PARTIAL]** 100% test coverage for MVP features (pattern matching, path resolution,
  error handling, link provider, ghost text preview). Advanced edge cases,
  recursive/circular, and accessibility tests are **[PLANNED]**.

### 8.1 Coverage Targets

- **Overall Branch Coverage:** 90-100%
- **Critical Paths:** 100% coverage required for:
  - Error handling logic
  - File I/O operations
  - Path resolution
  - Circular reference detection
- **UI Components:** 80-90% coverage (CodeLens, decorations, diagnostics)

### 8.2 Test Types

#### 8.2.1 Unit Tests (70-80% of test suite)

- Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- Mock all VS Code API dependencies
- Fast execution without requiring a VS Code instance
- Use Mocha (VS Code standard) or Jest

**Key Areas to Cover:**

- Pattern matching for snippet syntax (all quote variations, edge cases)
- Path resolution logic (absolute, relative to file, relative to workspace)
- Section marker parsing and validation
- Recursive snippet expansion logic
- Circular reference detection algorithm
- Error message formatting

#### 8.2.2 Integration Tests (15-25% of test suite)

- Use `@vscode/test-electron` to run tests in real VS Code instance
- Test actual VS Code API interactions
- Verify components work together correctly

**Key Areas to Cover:**

- Document Link Provider returns correct links
- CodeLens Provider displays correctly
- Diagnostics are created with proper ranges and messages
- Text decorations are applied correctly
- File system operations via `workspace.fs` API

#### 8.2.3 End-to-End Tests (5-10% of test suite)

- Test complete user workflows in full VS Code instance
- Use workspace fixtures with realistic file structures

**Key Scenarios:**

- Open markdown file with snippets, verify links and previews appear
- Click snippet link, verify correct file opens
- Toggle preview via CodeLens, verify decoration appears/disappears
- Save file with new snippet, verify detection and rendering
- Test with missing files, verify error diagnostics appear

### 8.3 Test Fixtures

Create a standardized test workspace with:

- Sample markdown files with various snippet patterns
- Referenced snippet files (code, text, markdown)
- Edge cases:
  - Missing files (for error handling tests)
  - Files with circular references
  - Files with invalid section markers
  - Large files (for performance tests)
  - Files with nested snippets (multiple levels)
- Cross-platform path variations (Windows `\` vs Unix `/`)

### 8.4 Mocking Strategy

Mock VS Code APIs consistently:

- `workspace.fs.readFile` - for file I/O testing
- `workspace.getWorkspaceFolder` - for path resolution
- `window.createTextEditorDecorationType` - for decoration testing
- `languages.registerDocumentLinkProvider` - for link provider testing
- `languages.registerCodeLensProvider` - for CodeLens testing

Use dependency injection where possible to make mocking easier.

### 8.6 Continuous Integration

- Run tests on multiple platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows
- Generate and publish coverage reports
- Fail builds if coverage drops below threshold (90%)
- Run on every pull request and commit to main branch
- Test against multiple VS Code versions (current stable, previous stable, insiders)

### 8.7 Edge Cases to Test

**Pattern Matching:**

- Escaped quotes within file paths
- Spaces in file paths
- Unicode characters in paths
- Empty file paths
- Missing closing quote
- Multiple snippets on same line (if allowed)

**Path Resolution:**

- Absolute paths (Unix and Windows style)
- Relative paths with `..` navigation
- Paths with symbolic links
- Case sensitivity (macOS/Linux vs Windows)
- Paths exceeding OS limits

**Recursive Processing:**

- Snippets at maximum depth (100 levels)
- Immediate circular reference (A → A)
- Delayed circular reference (A → B → C → A)
- Mixed valid and circular references in same file

**Performance:**

- Large snippet files (approaching 1MB limit)
- Many snippets in single file (50+ snippets)
- Rapid typing/editing (debounce behavior)
- Opening multiple files simultaneously

**Error Conditions:**

- All error types from section 2.4 (missing files, invalid paths, permissions,
  invalid sections)
- Malformed snippet syntax
- File changes during processing
- Workspace folder not available

## 9. CI/CD and Release Management Requirements

- **[PARTIAL]** CI runs lint, type check, tests, and build verification. Release-please
  manages changelog and versioning. Security scanning, advanced release automation,
  and documentation checks are **[PLANNED]**.

### 9.1 Continuous Integration Pipeline

**Platform:** GitHub Actions

**Required Workflows:**

#### 9.1.1 Pull Request Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)

Runs on every pull request and push to main branch.

**Jobs:**

1. **Commit Message Validation**
   - Validate all commits in PR follow Conventional Commits specification
   - Use `wagoid/commitlint-github-action`
   - Fail if any commit is non-conventional
   - Provides detailed error messages for violations

2. **Lint and Type Check**
   - Run ESLint (`npm run lint`)
   - Run TypeScript compiler in check mode (`npm run check-types`)
   - Fail fast on any errors
   - Matrix: Not required (single run sufficient)

3. **Test Suite**
   - Run on matrix of platforms: `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`
   - Run on matrix of VS Code versions: `stable`, `insiders`
   - Execute all tests (`npm test`)
   - Generate coverage report
   - Upload coverage to codecov.io or similar service
   - Fail if coverage drops below 90% threshold

4. **Build Verification**
   - Run production build (`npm run package`)
   - Verify .vsix package is created successfully
   - Check package size (warn if > 5MB)
   - Upload .vsix as workflow artifact for manual testing

**Performance Requirements:**

- Complete within 15 minutes under normal conditions
- Use caching for `node_modules` to speed up runs
- Parallel execution of independent jobs

**Required Checks:**

- All jobs must pass before PR can be merged (including commit message validation)
- At least one approving review required (repository setting)
- Branch must be up to date with main

#### 9.1.2 Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

Runs on schedule (weekly) and on pull requests.

**Jobs:**

1. **Dependency Audit**
   - Run `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
   - Fail on high or critical vulnerabilities
   - Create issue automatically for moderate vulnerabilities

2. **CodeQL Analysis** (Optional but recommended)
   - Use GitHub's CodeQL action for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Scan for security issues and code quality problems
   - Create alerts in Security tab

**Frequency:**

- Weekly scheduled run (every Monday)
- On pull requests that modify `package.json` or `package-lock.json`

### 9.2 Release Management with release-please

**Tool:** [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) by Google

**Strategy:** Conventional Commits + Automated Changelog

#### 9.2.1 Release Please Configuration

**Commit Convention:** [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

**Required Commit Types:**

- `feat:` - New feature (triggers MINOR version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fix (triggers PATCH version bump)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes (no version bump)
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (no version bump)
- `test:` - Test changes (no version bump)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (no version bump)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` - Breaking change (triggers MAJOR version bump)
  - Include in commit footer or use `!` suffix: `feat!:`

**Example Commits:**

```text
feat: add support for named section snippets

fix: resolve path traversal vulnerability in symlink handling

docs: update README with new toggle commands

feat!: change default preview state to 'off'
BREAKING CHANGE: Users who relied on previews being on by default will need to update settings
```

**Configuration File:** `.release-please-manifest.json`

```json
{
  ".": "0.0.1"
}
```

**Config File:** `release-please-config.json`

```json
{
  "packages": {
    ".": {
      "release-type": "node",
      "package-name": "mkdocs-snippet-lens",
      "changelog-path": "CHANGELOG.md",
      "bump-minor-pre-major": true,
      "bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major": true,
      "extra-files": [
        "package.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 9.2.2 Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

**Trigger:** On push to `main` branch

**Jobs:**

1. **Create or Update Release PR**
   - Use `google-github-actions/release-please-action`
   - Analyzes commits since last release
   - Creates/updates a release PR with:
     - Updated version in `package.json`
     - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes
     - Git tag for the new version
   - Groups related changes by type (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.)

2. **Build and Publish** (runs only when release PR is merged)
   - Triggered by release-please creating a GitHub Release
   - Runs on `ubuntu-latest` only (publishing needs single run)
   - Steps:
     1. Checkout code at release tag
     2. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
     3. Run tests (`npm test`)
     4. Build production package (`npm run package`)
     5. Publish to VS Code Marketplace using `@vscode/vsce`
     6. Upload .vsix to GitHub Release as asset

**Required Secrets:**

- `VSCE_PAT` - Personal Access Token for VS Code Marketplace publishing
  - Obtained from Azure DevOps for VS Code Marketplace
  - Stored in GitHub repository secrets
  - Scoped to marketplace publishing only

**Example Workflow Structure:**

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      release_created: ${{ steps.release.outputs.release_created }}
      tag_name: ${{ steps.release.outputs.tag_name }}
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v4
        id: release
        with:
          release-type: node
          package-name: mkdocs-snippet-lens

  publish:
    needs: release-please
    if: ${{ needs.release-please.outputs.release_created }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run package
      - run: npx @vscode/vsce publish -p ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
      - uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        # Upload .vsix to GitHub Release
```

#### 9.2.3 Version Management

**Versioning Scheme:** Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

- **Format:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **Initial Version:** 0.1.0 (pre-1.0 for initial development)
- **Pre-1.0 Behavior:**
  - Minor bumps for new features
  - Patch bumps for bug fixes
  - Breaking changes allowed without major bump (0.x.y is unstable)
- **Post-1.0 Behavior:**
  - Strict SemVer compliance
  - MAJOR for breaking changes
  - MINOR for new features
  - PATCH for bug fixes

**Version Sources:**

- Single source of truth: `package.json` `version` field
- Automatically updated by release-please
- Git tags created automatically (e.g., `v1.2.3`)

### 9.3 Marketplace Publishing Requirements

#### 9.3.1 Pre-Publish Checklist

Before first marketplace publication, ensure:

- [ ] Extension icon created (128x128px PNG)
- [ ] README.md complete with screenshots
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md initialized
- [ ] LICENSE file present (e.g., MIT)
- [ ] Repository URL set in `package.json`
- [ ] Publisher name registered on VS Code Marketplace
- [ ] `publisher` field in `package.json` matches registered publisher
- [ ] All required `package.json` metadata fields populated:
  - `displayName`
  - `description`
  - `categories`
  - `keywords`
  - `repository`
  - `bugs`
  - `license`

#### 9.3.2 Publishing Process

**Manual First Release:**

1. Create publisher account at <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage>
2. Generate Personal Access Token in Azure DevOps
3. Add `VSCE_PAT` secret to GitHub repository
4. Tag and publish first version manually to verify setup:

   ```bash
   npm run package
   npx @vscode/vsce publish
   ```

5. Verify extension appears on marketplace
6. Test installation from marketplace

**Automated Subsequent Releases:**

1. Merge changes to `main` using conventional commits
2. Release-please creates/updates release PR automatically
3. Review and merge release PR
4. Workflow automatically publishes to marketplace
5. Verify new version appears on marketplace

#### 9.3.3 Rollback Procedure

If a published version has critical issues:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Unpublish broken version from marketplace (if possible)
   - Or publish hotfix version immediately

2. **Hotfix Process:**
   - Create hotfix branch from tag: `git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.4 v1.2.3`
   - Fix the issue
   - Commit with `fix:` prefix
   - Open PR to main
   - Merge and let release-please create new version

3. **Communication:**
   - Update CHANGELOG with note about issue
   - Consider posting in marketplace Q&A
   - Update GitHub release notes if needed

### 9.4 Branch Protection and Workflow

**Protected Branch:** `main`

**Required Settings:**

- Require pull request reviews before merging (minimum 1 approval)
- Require status checks to pass:
  - Lint and Type Check
  - Test Suite (all platforms/versions)
  - Build Verification
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- No force pushes allowed
- No deletions allowed

**Development Workflow:**

1. Create feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
2. Make changes using conventional commits
3. Push and create pull request
4. CI runs all checks
5. Request review
6. Merge to main (squash or merge commit)
7. Release-please automatically processes on main push

**Commit Message Enforcement:**

Conventional Commits are **required** for this project to support automated
versioning and changelog generation via release-please.

**Configuration:**

- **Commitlint:** `.commitlintrc.yml` with `@commitlint/config-conventional`
- **Supported types:** `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`,
  `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`
- **Rules:**
  - Header max length: 100 characters
  - Type must be lowercase and non-empty
  - Subject must be lowercase, non-empty, no trailing period
  - Body and footer: 100 char line limit, blank line before each section

**Local Enforcement (commit-msg hook):**

- Use Husky to install Git hooks
- Install: `npx husky init` and configure commit-msg hook
- Hook runs commitlint on every commit
- **Blocks non-conforming commits** before they are created
- Provides immediate feedback to developers
- Hook file: `.husky/commit-msg`

**Example hook:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
npx --no -- commitlint --edit $1
```

**CI/CD Enforcement (GitHub Actions):**

- Validate all commits in PR against conventional commits spec
- Job: `commitlint` in PR validation workflow
- **Fails build** if any commit is non-conventional
- Runs on: `pull_request` events
- Uses: `wagoid/commitlint-github-action`

**Example workflow job:**

```yaml
commitlint:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    - uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v6
```

**Developer Setup:**

1. Clone repository
2. Run `npm install` (installs husky automatically via prepare script)
3. Husky creates `.husky/` directory and hooks
4. Commit-msg hook validates all commits locally

**Benefits:**

- Prevents non-conventional commits from entering repository
- Ensures release-please can parse all commits correctly
- Generates accurate CHANGELOG automatically
- Consistent commit history across all contributors
- Fast feedback loop (fails at commit time, not PR time)

**Troubleshooting:**

- If hook doesn't run: `npx husky install`
- Skip hook in emergency: `git commit --no-verify` (discouraged)
- Reword last commit: `git commit --amend`
- Interactive rebase to fix old commits: `git rebase -i HEAD~n`

### 9.5 Environment and Secrets Management

**Required Secrets:**

- `VSCE_PAT` - VS Code Marketplace publishing token
  - Scope: Marketplace publishing
  - Rotation: Annually or if compromised
  - Access: Repository admins only

**Optional Secrets:**

- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Code coverage reporting (if using codecov.io)
- `NPM_TOKEN` - If publishing to npm registry (not required for VS Code extensions)

**Environment Variables:**

- Use GitHub Actions built-in variables where possible
- No sensitive data in workflow files
- All secrets via GitHub Secrets only

### 9.6 Monitoring and Notifications

**Build Status:**

- Add status badges to README.md:
  - CI build status
  - Code coverage percentage
  - Latest release version
  - VS Code Marketplace version

**Notifications:**

- GitHub Actions failures notify via email (GitHub default)
- Consider Slack/Discord webhook for release notifications (optional)
- Monitor marketplace reviews and Q&A regularly

**Metrics to Track:**

- Installation count (from marketplace)
- Build success rate
- Average build time
- Code coverage trend
- Time from commit to release

### 9.7 Testing in CI/CD

**Test Execution:**

- Run full test suite on every PR and main push
- Use test retries for flaky tests (max 2 retries)
- Collect test results and publish as artifacts
- Display test summary in PR comments (optional enhancement)

**Coverage Reporting:**

- Generate coverage report in XML and HTML formats
- Upload to coverage service (codecov.io or coveralls.io)
- Comment on PR with coverage delta
- Block merge if coverage drops below 90%

**Cross-Platform Testing:**

- Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux simultaneously
- Fail fast: stop other jobs if one platform fails
- Archive platform-specific test results separately

### 9.8 Documentation in CI/CD

**Automated Checks:**

- Verify all links in README work (using markdown-link-check)
- Check markdown syntax (using markdownlint)
- Ensure CHANGELOG follows format (release-please validates this)
- Verify screenshots exist and are accessible

**Auto-Generated Docs:**

- TypeDoc for API documentation (optional, future enhancement)
- Publish to GitHub Pages on release (optional)
