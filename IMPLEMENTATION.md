## v0.1.0 - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Goal:** Prove the core concept works and delivers value to users. Establish
technical foundation.

**Timeline:** 4 weeks

**Success Criteria:**

- Users can click snippet references to open files
- Users can see basic ghost text previews
- Extension works on all three platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Code coverage == 100%
- Tests fail if coverage < 100%
- CI fails on insufficient coverage
- No critical bugs

### Features In Scope

#### 1. Basic Snippet Detection

**Description:** Detect simple `--8<-- "path/to/file"` syntax in markdown files.

**Requirements:**

- Pattern matching for entire file inclusion only
  - `--8<-- "path/to/file.ext"`
  - `--8<-- 'path/to/file.ext'`
  - Support both single and double quotes
- Trigger on file open and save only (no live typing detection)
- Scan only `.md` files
- Use basic regex pattern

**Out of Scope for v0.1:**

- Named sections (`:section_name`)
- Line ranges (`:start:end`)
- Multiple ranges (`:1:3,5:6`)
- Negative indexes
- Recursive snippet expansion

**Implementation Notes:**

- Regex: `/--8<--\s+["']([^"']+)["']/g`
- Store detected snippets with line numbers and file paths
- No caching in v0.1 - re-scan on each trigger

**Known Limitations (documented in README):**

- Does not handle escaped quotes inside paths: `--8<-- "path/with\"quote.md"`
- Does not handle paths with line breaks (unlikely but possible)
- These are acceptable for MVP; consider robust parser in v0.2+ if needed

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for regex pattern matching
- Edge cases: escaped quotes, unicode, spaces in paths
- Integration test: detect snippets in sample markdown file

#### 2. Document Link Provider

**Description:** Make snippet file paths clickable to open referenced files.

**Requirements:**

- Implement `DocumentLinkProvider` interface
- Extract file path from snippet syntax
- Create clickable link for entire quoted path
- Clicking opens file in new editor tab
- Show tooltip on hover: "Open snippet file"

**Path Resolution (Simple):**

- Try absolute path first
- Try relative to current file's directory
- Try relative to workspace root
- Try relative to configured `basePath` setting
- Show error diagnostic if file not found

**Resolution Precedence (document in code/README):**

1. If path is absolute (starts with `/` or drive letter on Windows), use as-is
2. Else try relative to current markdown file's directory
3. Else try relative to workspace root
4. Else try relative to configured `basePath`
5. If all fail, show diagnostic error

**Out of Scope for v0.1:**

- Opening to specific line numbers
- Preview on hover
- Path traversal protection (implement in v1.0)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use `vscode.Uri.file()` for path resolution
- Handle file not found gracefully with diagnostic
- Document precedence order in code comments

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for path resolution logic
- Test precedence: what happens when same filename exists in multiple locations
- Integration tests for link provider registration
- Cross-platform path testing (Windows drive letters, Unix paths)

#### 3. Simple Ghost Text Preview

**Description:** Display snippet file content below the snippet line using text
decorations.

**Requirements:**

- Use `TextEditorDecorationType` with `after` property
- Display content as faded italic text
- Limit to first 20 lines (hardcoded in v0.1)
- Show truncation indicator if file > 20 lines: `... (XX more lines)`
- Manual toggle only - OFF by default
- Command: "MkDocs Snippet Lens: Toggle All Previews"

**Styling:**

- Use `editorCodeLens.foreground` theme color
- Font style: italic
- No fancy borders or margins in v0.1

**Out of Scope for v0.1:**

- Per-snippet toggle
- CodeLens toggle button
- State persistence
- Auto-refresh on file changes
- Configurable preview line limit

**Implementation Notes:**

- Single decoration type reused for all previews
- Global toggle state in memory only (lost on reload)
- Load file content synchronously for simplicity (optimize in v0.2)
- Handle file read errors with error message in preview
- **Note:** Week 1 spike will validate multi-line decoration approach; if `after`
  property has limitations, may need to use decoration ranges or alternative
  strategy

**Performance Considerations:**

- Synchronous loading acceptable for MVP but measure impact in Week 3
- If >50 snippets or files >100KB cause lag, document as known limitation
- Plan async loading for v0.2 based on Week 3 performance test results

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for content truncation logic
- Integration tests for decoration application
- Visual tests (manual) for styling
- Performance test: 50+ snippets with various file sizes (Week 3)

#### 4. Basic Error Handling

**Description:** Show diagnostic errors for common failure cases.

**Requirements:**

- Diagnostic (red squiggle) for file not found
- Error message: "Snippet file not found: 'path/to/file'"
- Clear diagnostics when file is opened or snippet is removed
- Show error in preview area instead of content

**Out of Scope for v0.1:**

- Permission denied errors
- Invalid path syntax validation
- Security validation (path traversal)
- Detailed error context chains

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use `DiagnosticCollection` for errors
- Create diagnostics for snippet path range only
- Update diagnostics on document change

**Testing:**

- Unit tests for diagnostic creation
- Integration tests verifying diagnostics appear in Problems panel

#### 5. Basic Configuration

**Description:** Minimal settings to make extension usable.

**Settings:**

```json
{
  "mkdocsLens.basePath": {
    "type": "string",
    "default": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "description": "Base path for resolving snippet references"
  },
  "mkdocsLens.enable": {
    "type": "boolean",
    "default": true,
    "description": "Enable/disable the extension"
  }
}
```

**Out of Scope for v0.1:**

- `previewLines` (hardcoded to 20)
- `defaultPreviewState` (hardcoded to off)
- `maxFileSize` (no limit in v0.1)
- All security settings

**Implementation Notes:**

## Command Implementation Schedule

This section maps the commands defined in [REQUIREMENTS.md Section
2.5](REQUIREMENTS.md#25-feature-command-palette-commands) to their implementation
phases.

### v0.1.0 - MVP Commands

**Essential for basic functionality:**

- `mkdocsLens.toggleAllPreviews` - Core command for showing/hiding all previews

**Rationale:** Start with single toggle command to prove concept and get user
feedback.

### v0.2.0 - Enhanced Control Commands

**Added for better UX:**

- `mkdocsLens.showAllPreviews` - Explicit show (clearer intent than toggle)
- `mkdocsLens.hideAllPreviews` - Explicit hide (clearer intent than toggle)
- `mkdocsLens.toggleCurrentPreview` - Per-snippet control via CodeLens
- `mkdocsLens.refreshAllPreviews` - Manual refresh capability

**Context Keys Implemented:**

- `mkdocsLens:hasSnippetAtCursor` - Enables commands for current snippet
- `mkdocsLens:hasSnippets` - Enables document-level commands

**Rationale:** Users need granular control. Explicit show/hide commands avoid
confusion about toggle state.

### v0.3.0 - Navigation & Refresh Commands

**Added for workflow efficiency:**

- `mkdocsLens.refreshCurrentPreview` - Refresh single snippet
- `mkdocsLens.goToNextSnippet` - Navigate forward through snippets
- `mkdocsLens.goToPreviousSnippet` - Navigate backward through snippets

**Rationale:** Navigation commands improve productivity when working with many
snippets. Targeted refresh reduces unnecessary reloads.

### v1.1.0+ - Future Commands

**Deferred for user feedback:**

- `mkdocsLens.copySnippetContent` - Accessibility feature for screen readers
- `mkdocsLens.openSnippetBeside` - Power user feature for split editing
- `mkdocsLens.clearCache` - Debug/troubleshooting utility
- `mkdocsLens.showOutputChannel` - Debug/troubleshooting utility

**Rationale:** Prioritize core functionality first. Add utility commands based on
user requests and issues.

## Development Standards

### Development Methodology

**This project uses Test Driven Development (TDD).**

#### TDD Process (Mandatory)

All features must be developed using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Write a failing test** - Write only enough test code to fail
2. **Make it pass** - Write minimal implementation to pass the test
3. **Refactor** - Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat** - Continue with next test

**Key Principles:**
- Tests written BEFORE implementation
- No code written without a failing test first
- Highly iterative - many small cycles
- No premature implementation or features
- Tests drive the design

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript:** Strict mode enabled
- **Linting:** ESLint with recommended rules
- **Formatting:** Prettier (or consistent manual formatting)
- **Testing:** 100% coverage required, enforced by test runner and CI
- **Documentation:** JSDoc for all public APIs

### Git Workflow

- **Branch:** Feature branches from main (`feat/snippet-detection`)
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits format
- **PR:** Required for all changes, self-review thoroughly
- **Main:** Always deployable, protected branch

### Testing Strategy

**All testing follows TDD methodology - tests written before implementation.**

- **Unit tests:** 70-80% of test suite (written first, drive implementation)
- **Integration tests:** 15-25% of test suite (written before integration code)
- **E2E tests:** 5-10% of test suite (written before end-to-end features)
- **Manual testing:** Before each release, all platforms
- **Coverage requirement:** 100% across all test types
- **Enforcement:** Tests must fail if coverage < 100%, CI must fail

**TDD Workflow:**
- Write failing test → Run test (verify RED) → Write minimal code → Run test (verify
  GREEN) → Refactor → Repeat

### Performance Budgets

- **Activation time:** < 500ms
- **Sync operations:** < 50ms
- **User-perceived actions:** < 200ms
- **Memory footprint:** < 50MB typical, < 200MB max
- **Extension size:** < 5MB

### Documentation Requirements

- **Code comments:** For complex logic, security-critical code
- **JSDoc:** All exported functions/classes
- **README:** Up-to-date with features and screenshots
- **CHANGELOG:** Updated with every release
- **Implementation.md:** Updated as plans change

## Risk Mitigation

Refer to [RISKS.md](RISKS.md) for comprehensive risk assessment.

**Key Risks to Monitor:**

1. **VS Code API limitations** - Prototype early
2. **Performance issues** - Profile and optimize continuously
3. **Scope creep** - Stick to plan, defer features to later versions
4. **Security vulnerabilities** - Review code carefully, use security tools
5. **Low adoption** - Focus on quality and user experience
